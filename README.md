Concept Overview

At the heart of WeKnow is the idea of reciprocal learning. Users can list the hobbies they are interested in learning as well as those they are capable of teaching. The app then intelligently matches users with complementary interests, creating potential pairs for skill exchange. This peer-to-peer learning model not only facilitates skill acquisition but also fosters a supportive community.

-   Geolocation Matching: Users have the option to find matches within their local area, making in-person meetups possible.

### Communication Platform

-   Video Integration: For remote connections, the app supports video calls, enabling virtual learning sessions.

### Community Engagement

-   Feedback System: Users can leave reviews and ratings for their learning experiences, contributing to the trustworthiness and reliability of the community.
-   Skill Badges: Earn badges as you learn and teach, showcasing your growing skill set and contributions to the community.

### Learning Resources
